# Kubernetes Manifests 📦

A collection of **Kubernetes manifest files** to deploy and manage various workloads and resources on a Kubernetes cluster.

This repository contains a **structured collection of Kubernetes manifest files**, organized by resource type. It is designed for **learning, practice, and real-world Kubernetes deployments**.

Each folder represents a specific Kubernetes object and contains YAML manifests demonstrating how that resource is defined and used.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Running Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, Docker Desktop, EKS, AKS, GKE)
* `kubectl` installed and configured

Verify cluster access:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

---

## ▶️ Applying Manifests

Apply all Kubernetes manifests at once:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes_manifest_files/
```

Apply manifests from a specific folder:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes_manifest_files/Deployment/
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get svc -A
kubectl get pv
kubectl get pvc
```

## 🎯 Kubernetes Learning Path

Follow this **recommended learning order** to understand Kubernetes concepts step by step:

1. **Pod** – Understand the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
2. **Deployment** – Manage stateless applications and rolling updates
3. **Service** – Expose applications inside and outside the cluster
4. **Ingress** – HTTP/HTTPS routing to Services
5. **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** – Automatically scale pods based on metrics
6. **PersistentVolume & PersistentVolumeClaim (PV/PVC)** – Manage application storage

This progression mirrors real-world Kubernetes usage and is ideal for beginners to advanced learners.

## 📘 Example YAML Explanations (Per Folder)

### 🟦 Pod

Defines a single running instance of a container.

**Key fields:**

* `apiVersion`, `kind`
* `metadata.name`
* `spec.containers`

Used mainly for learning and debugging.

---

### 🟦 Deployment

Manages replicated Pods and supports rolling updates.

**Key fields:**

* `replicas`
* `selector.matchLabels`
* `template`

Used for stateless applications.

---

### 🟦 Service

Exposes Pods using a stable network endpoint.

**Common types:**

* ClusterIP
* NodePort
* LoadBalancer

Maps traffic to Pods via labels.

---

### 🟦 Ingress

Routes external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to Services.

**Key fields:**

* `rules`
* `host`
* `path`

Requires an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX).

---

### 🟦 HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

Automatically scales Pods based on CPU or memory usage.

**Key fields:**

* `minReplicas`
* `maxReplicas`
* `metrics`

Works with Deployments and StatefulSets.

---

### 🟦 PersistentVolume (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

Provides persistent storage for applications.

* **Static Provisioning PV**: Manually created storage
* **Dynamic Provisioning PV**: Automatically created using StorageClass

Ensures data survives Pod restarts.
